# ItemCatalog
Project 4 of udacity's fsnd

## Project Overview
An application that provides a list of items within a variety of categories as well as provide a user registration and authentication system. Registered users will have the ability to post, edit and delete their own items.

## What Will I Learn?
I learnt how to develop a RESTful web application using the Python framework Flask along with implementing third-party OAuth authentication, when to properly use the various HTTP methods available and how these methods relate to CRUD (create, read, update and delete) operations.

## How Does This Help My Career?
* Efficiently interacting with data is the backbone upon which performant web applications are built
* Properly implementing authentication mechanisms and appropriately mapping HTTP methods to CRUD operations are core features of a properly secured web application
